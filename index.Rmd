# Introduction

Everyone deserves access to quality health care. However, this is not a reality in the United States. There are systemic health inequities, and the marginalized populations suffer the consequences. To examine this issue, we focus our BLOG on regional health insurance coverage status, the role of intersectionality in health disparities, and people's experiences with public insurance.

We begin this BLOG with an overview of health care disparities in the United States by looking at how health insurance coverage status differs across states over time. We then analyze how socially disadvantaged populations experience greater obstacles to health based on their racial/ethnic group; socioeconomic status; gender and sexual orientation. Finally, in response to our shared passion for improving minority groups' access to quality health care, we present an analysis of quality of public health insurance by examining people's opinions about their health insurance plans captured in Medicare ratings data set.



## Questions of Interest

1. blah
2. What are the factors that drive health care inequity? Does intersectionality play a role in exacerbating inequality even in health care settings?
3. Are Medicare patients getting the care needed? If not, what improvements should be made to Medicare to enhance the quality of health care?


# Data

**Dataset 1**

* [Link to the dataset](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription-Drug-Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/PerformanceData)

* Description:The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses a five-star quality rating system to provide information about health plan quality. It measures Medicare beneficiariesâ€™ experience with their health plans and the health care system. CMS assigns Star Ratings based on grouping measure scores, and we used the data set that contains the individual measures of quality under five categories such as member experience or how well the plan provides screenings and immunization. The data set was in .csv format, and we compared data over time-from 2016 to 2022.

* The dataset contains various metrics of health care quality for each Medicare plan, so it allows users to compare one plan to another based on those metrics. Each measure reflects beneficiaries' perspectives of the care they received, and we focus on measures related to preventive services, treatments, and consumer satisfaction.

### Background

#### What is Medicare?
Medicare helps provide healthcare coverage to U.S. citizens who are 65 years of age or older, as well as people with certain disabilities. Medicare consists of four parts, and we focus on Part C: Medical Advantage. Medical Advantage is an all-in-one alternative to Original Medicare, which includes drug coverage and extra benefits not covered by Original Medicare. These plans are provided by contracting private insurance companies instead of the federal government.

#### Has Medicare been effective in delivering quality health care?
The Affordable Care Act, which was passed under Obama administration, attempted to expand healthcare coverage to low-income Americans of up to 138% of the poverty line. Yet, obtaining health insurance does not necessarily ensure better access to health care. It is reported that Medicare patients still face barriers to care, such as delayed treatment of chronic conditions, resulting in poorer health outcomes. Thus, we used Medicare quality ratings data to contemplate about how to strengthen public insurance. We believe that examining reviews for Medicare would be crucial for ensuring that its beneficiaries are able to access the medical care they need. 

### Wordcloud

We examine the word cloud to get a sense about people's experiences with Medicare. The quality ratings data set measures percentage of plan members who took advantage of each service offered by the plan, such as diabetes care, or had certain experiences with the plan, such as whether they had access to care or appointments in a timely fashion. Since we aim to find room for improvement regarding the quality of care, we performed some data wrangling to reverse the percentages and focus on people who did *NOT*  utilize the services or felt *unsatisfied* with their health insurance. Through the word cloud, we hope to gain knowledge about people's opinions about Medicare and explore how the public health insurance can be strengthened.

      dat %>%
        with(wordcloud(words = sentences, freq = mean, scale = c(2,0.8), 
                       colors=my_pal[as.factor(rating_type)], ordered.colors = TRUE))
      
      # legend("topright", legend = levels(factor(ratings$rating_type)),
      #        text.col=brewer.pal(3, "Dark2")[unique(factor(ratings$rating_type))])
    })
  },
  options = list(height = 600)
)
```


The above word cloud shows what patients say about their health care experience; text size corresponds to percentage of plan members who reported to have certain experiences, and words are colored by different types of metrics. By default, it displays all three types (i.e. prevention, treatment, customer satisfaction). Words classified as Treatment seem to stand out in their sizes across the board, which implies that a lot of plan members did not avail the services related to treatment of chronic/acute conditions, such as diabetes care. Also, people's experiences with preventive services such as screenings or immunizations are the second largest words displayed in the visualization. However, this should not be translated into the plan's poor performance in preventive care because according to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Affordable Care Act allowed the Medicare beneficiaries to have access to free preventive services; that being said, the plan members simply may not have taken advantage of those services because they were not in need of them, not because of certain barriers or plan's poor performance. 

In order to extend our knowledge about actual performance of Medicare plans, we pay close attention to members' general opinions about the plan's care and services, which had the least presence in the across-the-board visualization. We do so by selecting *Customer Satisfaction* as the sole input in the Shiny app. The most conspicuous words in the word cloud filtered by the customer satisfaction are "Less Timely Care/Appointments" and "Not Getting Needed Care". This suggests that a lot of people were not able to get care or appointments quickly, nor could they get needed care. In other words, although they are enrolled in Medicare, they still experience some barriers to health care access. We associate those obstacles with long wait times that disincentivize seeking care; cost-sharing charges in health insurance plans; administrative burdens that discourage access to care. 

Another notable finding is that the words "Complaints" and "Members Choosing to Leave the Plan" increase in their sizes from 2019 to 2022. This means that there has been an increasing number of people who filed complaints against their Medicare plans and chose to leave the plan over that time period. This may be attributable to the COVID-19 outbreak as the pandemic may have resulted in decline in plan's performance; the job losses caused by the pandemic may have also disrupted job-based health coverage for millions of people.


### Discussion

The examination of word cloud revealed that a lot of people specifically did not (or could not) receive treatment for their health conditions, although they were covered by Medicare. This may be plausibly attributable to the fact that people tend to go without needed treatments because of financial barriers. Co-payments, deductibles, or co-insurance may have deterred even people with insurance from getting those services. This finding suggests that there is a pressing need to drive down costs for Medicare beneficiaries to make it more affordable for them to fully take advantage of critical health care services and stay healthy.

Another improvement to be made would be the quality of service delivery--specifically, access to care. Taking a closer look at the words classified as Customer Satisfaction, we found that people lacked timely access to care. We believe timeliness of access to care and other services is an extremely important indicator of the quality of the overall healthcare experience; not only are the prolonged wait times a source of potential frustration and dissatisfaction with care, but also they can directly translate into health outcomes, even possibly increasing mortality and morbidity. Thus, Medicare would have to work on streamlining its delivery systems to reduce wait times and ensure its beneficiaries receive the needed care at one of the most important times for them--as soon as possible. Additionally, we could also notice how the word cloud reflected the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care system. 

## Clustering Analysis {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Background

#### What is Intersectionality?
Intersectionality is a research approach that explores the interaction of different social categories such as race, ethnicity, gender, class, religion and sexuality. It assumes that social categories intersect in dynamic ways to privilege or disadvantage different people depending on their characteristics and contexts.

We believe the intersectionality is an important concept for understanding and responding to health inequalities. Because interactions between social identities can be multiplicative in effect, either positively or negatively, people who possess multiple minority identities are more likely to experience barriers to health care. In other words, health care inequity may disproportionately affect patients who are most in need of medical cae based on their social locations. Thus, understanding intersectionality would lead to precise insights about what drives health inequalities and who is affected by them.

### Clustering

We employ clustering analysis approach to examine the effect of intersectionality on health care inequities. We use the national health interview survey data set, which contains health insurance coverage status and various socioeconomic information of its respondents; we focus on race, sexual orientation, citizenship status, and education level. We hope to identify clusters of survey participants with various socioeconomic identities. By doing so, we aim to explore how coverage status differs according to different combinations of social locations.

```{r echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
demographic <- read_csv("data/demographic.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
demographic %>% 
  count(coverage)
```

```{r echo = TRUE}
set.seed(1128)
demographic_coverage <- demographic %>% 
  group_by(coverage) %>% 
  sample_n(2000)
```

Due to the fact that the data set contains a disproportionate number of survey respondents for each health insurance coverage status (i.e. whether insured or uninsured), our initial clustering analysis results were dominated by those insured. Instead, we drew 2500 stratified random samples from each coverage status group.


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
gower_df <- daisy(demographic_coverage, metric = "gower")
```

```{r, fig.cap = "Summary of the gower_df data frame"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gower_summary.png")
```

Given that the basic premise of clustering is the similarity/dissimilarity between the data points, we compute the Gower distance by using the `daisy` function from the `cluster` package. We choose the Gower distance because it allows us to calculate the distance matrix for mixed data that contains both categorical and quantitative variables, as opposed to the popular Euclidean or Manhattan distance metrics. The Gower distance is scaled in a numerical range of 0 (identical) and 1 (maximally dissimilar). 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
silhouette <- c()
silhouette = c(silhouette, NA)
for(i in 2:10){
  pam_clusters = pam(as.matrix(gower_df),
                     diss = TRUE,
                     k = i)
  silhouette = c(silhouette, pam_clusters$silinfo$avg.width)
}
plot(1:10, silhouette,
     xlab = "Clusters",
     ylab = "Silhouette Width")
lines(1:10, silhouette)
```

```{r, fig.cap = "Silhouette Width vs Number of Clusters"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/silhouette_plot.png")
```

Just like K-means and hierarchical clustering uses Euclidean distance matrix, **Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM)** algorithm goes hand-in-hand with the Gower distance. PAM iterates over and over until the **medoids** don't change their positions, instead of centroids in K-means clustering. The medoid of a cluster is a member of the cluster which is representative of the median of all the variables under consideration.

When running the PAM algorithm, we look at the **silhouette width** to select the optimal number of clusters. The silhouette width measures the similarity of each point to its cluster, and compares that to the similarity of the point with the closest neighboring cluster; a higher value is desirable. We calculate this metric for a range of cluster numbers and find where it is maximized. When we plot the silhouette width against the number of clusters, we can see the value is maximized at 5 clusters.


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
pam_nhis = pam(gower_df, diss = TRUE, k = 5)
demographic_coverage2[pam_nhis$medoids, ]
```

```{r}
medioids <- read_csv("data/medioids.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
medioids
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, include = FALSE}
pam_summary  <- demographic_coverage2 %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(cluster = pam_nhis$clustering) %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  do(cluster_summary = summary(.))
pam_summary$cluster_summary[5]
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
pam_summary <- readRDS("data/pam_summary.rds")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
pam_summary$cluster_summary[5]
```

We construct a PAM model with 5 clusters and examine medioids to interpret the clusters. In the medioids table above, each row represents a cluster; two clusters of respondents are insured, and the other three are not. We can also infer from the table that respondents belonging to Cluster 5 are uninsured and tend to be male; straight; Hispanic; non-US citizens; have less than a high school degree; earn the lowest income among all clusters. In other words, the uninsured tend to possess multiple social identities often identified as minority. However, it seems difficult to gain meaningful insights from the other 4 clusters because all of them tend to show very similar characteristics. This is due to the fact that there are a disproportionate number of survey participants who are White or straight. In order to address this issue, we apply clustering algorithm to the stratified random samples from each group of either race or sexual orientation.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
medioids_race <- read_csv("data/medioids_race.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
medioids_race %>% 
  arrange(coverage, desc(income_sqrt))
```

We created 75 stratified random samples from each race for each coverage status. The medioids table for 10 clusters grouped by race shows that uninsured respondents tend to possess less than a college degree; their median income tends to be less than approximately \$28K($167^2$) with the exception of White and Asian participants. Moreover, those with multiple social minority statuses (e.g. Female Asian who is a non-US citizen) are more likely to be uninsured than those who hold single minority identity (e.g. Male Asian who is a US-citizen). Additionally, the individuals not covered by health insurance tend to have lower education level and lower income than their insured counterparts with the same racial identity.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
tsne_object <- Rtsne(gower_df, is_distance = TRUE)
tsne_df <- tsne_object$Y %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  setNames(c("X", "Y")) %>%
  mutate(cluster = factor(pam_nhis$clustering))
```

To visualize our clustering analysis results, we use the t-SNE(t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) technique, which enables us to visualize a multi-dimensional data set.

```{r}
tsne <- read_csv("data/tsne.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  filter(coverage == "Not covered") %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor),
         cluster = as.factor(cluster))

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  plotlyOutput("clustering")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$clustering <- renderPlotly({
    my_pal <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n=10, name = "Set3")
    g <- ggplot(data = tsne, aes(x = X, y = Y, 
                                 text = paste(
                                   "Coverage Status: ", coverage,
                                   "\nRace: ", race,
                                   "\nSexual Orientation: ", sex_orientation,
                                   "\nEducation level: ", edu,
                                   "\nCitizenship status: ", citizen
                                   )
                                 )) +
      geom_point(aes(color = cluster, fill = cluster), size = 4, shape = 21) + 
      theme_bw() +
      scale_color_manual(values=c(my_pal)) +
      scale_fill_manual(values=c(paste(my_pal, "66", sep = "")))
    ggplotly(g, tooltip = "text")
  })
  
}
# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

We visualized our multi-dimensional data into a two-dimensional plot by using t-SNE technique. We focus only on the uninsured individuals in this plot. Users can identify demographic and socioeconomic information of each respondent by hovering over each point. The clusters seem to overlap a bit, but they are fairly distinctive overall. Looking at the plot as well as the medioids table, we find that our clustering results are dominated by those who identify as straight. We then move on to run clustering on stratified random samples drawn from each sexual orientation group.

## Including code and plots

You can embed code as normal, for example:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Let's clean up the format of that output instead of using the standard R output:

```{r pretty-table, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
summary(cars) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Speed", "Distance"),
        row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "1.5in") 
```

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

```{r eval = FALSE}
rating17_words <- read_csv("data/rating17_words.csv")
set.seed(1122)
rating17_words %>%
  with(wordcloud(words = sentences, freq = mean, scale = c(2,0.7), 
                 max.words = 17))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}

Take note of the default code chunk options in the `setup` code chunk, and adjust individual code chunk options as needed. for example, unlike the rest of the Rmd files we worked in this semester, the default code chunk option is `echo = FALSE`, so you will need to set `echo  = TRUE` for any code chunks you would like to display in the blog. 


## Including links and images/videos

You can include [links](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) and there are a few ways to embed  images! Both options for embedding images below can be used interchangeably. They both work for png, pdf, jpg, and even gif formats, and both support filepaths that are either URLs (for videos, you can include links to any valid YouTube or Vimeo URLs; see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/learnr-videos.html) for more details) or point to a location within your project directory. 

### Option 1: Markdown approach

![This is a figure caption. The artwork is called Safe Space by  [Kenesha Sneed](https://www.keneshasneed.com/#/safespace/)](img/Kenesha-Sneed_safe-space.jpeg)


### Option 2: Code chunk approach

```{r, fig.cap = "This is also figure caption"}
knitr::include_graphics("testing.gif")
```

## Including equations

Equations may be needed if you are explaining a new technique or perhaps providing some other relevant formulas in your exposition. There are two ways to include equations:

* Inline: $b \sim N(0, \sigma^2_b)$
* Display-style (displayed on its own line): $$\frac{\sigma^2_b}{\sigma^2_b + \sigma^2_e}$$

For typesetting equations appropriately, take a look at the *Symbols in math mode* section of this  [cheat sheet](https://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf)  (or do some extra Googling---there are *many* resources).

# Customizing your blog design

As a *final* detail **only** if you have time, you can explore options for customizing the style of your blog. By default, we are using the `readthedown` theme from the [**rmdformats** package](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) (see Line 6 of this file if you want to switch out themes). There are, I'm sure, many many many more similar packages with built in themes, or you can look into how to include a CSS code chunk to customize aspects of the current theme.  

There are some easy-to-change options that you can play around with:

* The theme itself (Line 6): `rmdformats::readthedown`, `rmdformats::downcute`, `rmdformats::robobook`, `rmdformats::material`,
  * For `downcute` only, you can add a new indented line below Line 6 with the code `downcute_theme: "chaos"` for the `downcute chaos` theme
  * I would *not* recommend the other themes that do not have the sidebar navigation
  
* Syntax highlighting options (Line 8, `highlight`): `"default"`, `"tango"`, `"pygments"`, `"kate"`, `"monochrome"`, `"espresso"`, `"zenburn"`, `"haddock"`, or `"textmate"` (or `NULL` for no syntax highlighting)


You can explore additional customizable YAML options by looking at the [**rmdformats** package](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) page or running, for example, `?rmdformats::readthedown()` to see the help documentation for a particular theme from the package.
